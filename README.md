# Joe Bumbulis Cypress Sample App for BrowserStack Challenge

Following the documentation provided by BrowsterStack and Cypress, I used the sample application to run cypress tests triggered on a jenkins server connected to BrowserStack Automate. 



## Kitchen Sink 

This is an example app used to showcase [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) testing. The application uses every API command in Cypress for demonstration purposes. Additionally this example app is configured to run tests in various CI platforms. The [tests](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink/blob/master/cypress/integration) are also heavily commented. For a full reference of our documentation, go to [docs.cypress.io](https://docs.cypress.io/).
